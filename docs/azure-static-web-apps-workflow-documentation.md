# Azure Static Web Apps Workflow Documentation

## Overview
The `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-purple-glacier-0055ab80f.yml` file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration that automates the deployment of a static web application to Azure Static Web Apps.

## Workflow Configuration

### `on`
This section defines the events that trigger the workflow. In this case, the workflow is triggered on `push` events to the `main` branch.

### `jobs`
The workflow defines a single job called `build-and-deploy`.

#### `build-and-deploy` Job
- `runs-on`: Specifies the operating system to use for the job, in this case `ubuntu-latest`.
- `steps`:
  - `uses`: Specifies the action to use, in this case the Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1 action.
  - `with`:
    - `azure_static_web_apps_api_token`: Provides the API token for the Azure Static Web Apps service.
    - `repo_token`: Provides the GitHub repository token.
    - `action`: Specifies the action to perform, in this case `deploy`.
    - `app_location`: Specifies the location of the application code.
    - `api_location`: Specifies the location of the API code (if any).
    - `output_location`: Specifies the location of the built output.
